      the Amazon rainforest of a remote South American land on the border between
      Venezuela and Brazil, a place completely isolated from the outside world, and
      has long been inhabited by the mysterious Yanomami tribe. Here, tribal people
      live in harmony with nature, consider animals friends, and consider forests
      home. Although living conditions are difficult due to lack of access to modern
      civilization and here the natural conditions are extremely harsh for humans,
      but for them, nature is the source of life, the home of life. the common home
      of all species cannot be lost. People living here have long given nature and
      animals here a great love, animals live in harmony with humans. The peaceful
      life continued until one day when the loud engine sounds from bulldozers, excavators,
      chainsaws, and horns broke the peace of the forest. Black smoke enveloped the
      fresh air of this place. That's also when the footsteps from the uninvited
      guests set down here. They are the loggers who destroy forests and hunt rare
      animals in this remote Amazon land. With the ambition of getting rich from
      the resources of the forest, they hunt for rare animals and exploit precious
      wood. In order to sell to the rich to make a large sum of money from this,
      they proceeded to scavenge all the products they found that they considered
      valuable despite the resistance of the tribesmen. Determined not to let his
      homeland and forest be trampled and destroyed, the wild friends were taken
      away. Seeing the children of animals lucky to escape, they cried because they
      could not see their mother's parents, because they were hungry. Aboriginal
      people think of the family scene of animals and think of their own homes. Everyone
      has the right to a home and family those people do not have the right to take
      the lives of animals. The people of the tribe decided to go to the city where
      the other loggers were keeping the animals in order to rescue the captured
      animals and bring them back to the green forest, with their families. And the
      journey to rescue the captured animals begins here! Along the way, they have
      to go through many challenges and obstacles that stand in their way. A total
      of 4 chapters including 12 levels players will pass through levels with different
      regions from jungle to desert to human place divided into big chapters for
      each region: The Jungle, The Swamp, Desert Area, and Abandoned Factory."

      At the beginning of the 20th century, there were 500,000 rhinos living freely
      in the wild. However, today, the number of rhinos remaining in the wild is
      not much. The vast majority of rhinos now live in national parks and reserves
      due to persistent poaching and habitat loss over the past several decades.
      Many projects to rescue and protect rhinos were established.
